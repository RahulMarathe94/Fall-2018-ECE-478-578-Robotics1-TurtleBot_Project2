# Robot Theatre

This section involved synching up 3 robots to perform a section of a play written by Prof. Perkowski. 

## 

Each robot recieved a version of the script file, newton.py, with the rosnode name and file path to their lines changed 
depending on which robot the script was given to (Dim and Einstein).

### Dependencies

The audio player used in the script depended on what was preinstalled on each robot. Our robot, Newton had a version of Ubuntu Mate for
Raspberry Pi installed as well as several python libraries. For audio, Python's Pygame library was used.
